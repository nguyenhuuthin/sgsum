Portugal's troubles differ from Ireland, which pledged to cover huge losses at its banks, and Greece, which lied about its debt.<q>Ratings agencies had downgraded Portugal's bonds to a notch above junk level and even its own bankers warned they could not keep buying national debt as they tussled with liquidity problems of their own.<q>The European commission's president, José Manuel Barroso, promised a swift response.<q>Investors had believed for months that a bailout for Portugal was almost inevitable, so the announcement by caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates on Wednesday is unlikely to hurt financial markets.<q>Other governments in the zone have therefore been pressing Portugal to request a bailout, and Lisbon's willingness to comply -- despite its bad memories of IMF-ordered austerity in the 1980s -- suggests the region remains able to summon enough political unity to address its debt problems.<q>The caretaker government immediately blamed opposition parties for rejecting an austerity package on 23 March, bringing Sócrates's socialist government down and forcing 5 June elections.<q>"We think the contagion stops here."<q>"Investors no longer seem to be worried about a full-blown euro zone crisis and the potential demise of the common currency because they assume mechanisms are now in place to prevent the crisis from escalating out of control," said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at U.S. firm Dwight Asset Management.<q>The government had admitted earlier on Wednesday that the political crisis was causing "irreparable damage" as borrowing costs rocketed.

Whatever you think of Gretchen Carlson’s previous work, she showed true courage in bucking the conservative orthodoxy of her audience in the first place, but standing by that position in the face of blistering, perhaps career-damaging fallout from her viewers shows either a willingness to put principle above personal gain, or an underestimation of the potential of that fallout.<q>Despite the fallout, Carlson stuck to her guns, as it were, telling viewers that it’s time to “get real” and address the gun side of the mass shooting equation, and calling out the “intolerance” of her critics: Maybe it’s time for more of us to start getting real and try to come together to actually get things done.<q>Now, 38 percent of respondents oppose the legislation, compared to the 50 percent who opposed it in December.<q>While we have full confidence in Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy, who have served the company brilliantly for over two decades, we have commenced an internal review of the matter."<q>This is a retaliatory suit for the network’s decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup" Ailes's statement said.<q>That 45% of Republicans are a reason to hope.<q>After dipping to a historic low in December, support for an assault weapons ban has now returned to its previous consistent majority: The survey, conducted in the days following the massacre at a popular Orlando gay night club, shows 57 percent of

Sykes stated he was knocked unconscious at least twice by employees at the restaurant and then shot several times with tasers by responding police officers.<q>He says he then started to make his way forward in the store when a different employee grabbed him from behind and other employees wrestled the gun from him, with at least one shot being fired during the struggle.<q>And while U.S. District Judge Sue L.

(note: Bernard Madoff is serving 150 years).<q>Declared indigent by the court, all of Stanford’s assets were frozen and he was represented by a public defender.<q>In March, Stanford was found guilty of running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme.<q>First, there was that strange interview on CNBC in which Stanford proclaimed his innocence.<q>Speaking on his own behalf, Stanford recounted his last three years, including his beating in September 2009.<q>Bloomberg News The government has come down on Stanford as more than just some white-collar criminal.<q>After a year’s delay in heading to trial, government psychologists determined he was faking it and set a court date.<q>In a blistering sentencing proposal, prosecutors sought a life sentence of 230 years for Stanford, calling him a “ruthless predator responsible for one of the most egregious frauds in history.” Stanford, however, sought only ten years, which the government asserting he was essentially looking for “time served.” He maintains that his operations were not, in fact, a Ponzi scheme at all, given he was actually investing the money in real-estate and other properties.<q>Long before being tried in court, Stanford was severely beaten by another inmate.
It also would be an admission by Mr. Dell that he wasn't able to pull off the changes needed to improve his company's revenue and profit under Wall Street's glare.<q>Late Monday, Mr. Dell was in talks with Microsoft Corp. and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners to offer shareholders between $13.50 and $13.75 a share, said people familiar with the matter, about a 25% premium to Dell's stock price in January before the possibility of a deal became public.<q>The buyout, if approved by shareholders, would be the largest such deal since the financial crisis.<q>Silver Lake Partners would invest more than $1 billion.<q>Shaw Wu, an analyst with Sterne Agee, estimates operating margins on servers, once about 15 percent, are now “in the high single digits, compared with the mid-single digits for PCs.” It is likely that servers will soon have PC-like margins, he said.<q>The Round Rock, Texas, firm once boasted a market capitalization above $100 billion as the world's largest PC maker.<q>"It's pretty simple: His name is on the door," one former company executive said of Mr. Dell.<q>“Dell’s transformation is well under way, but we recognize it will still take more time, investment and patience,” Mr. Dell wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday.<q>It will saddle Dell with $15 billion of new debt, and it does nothing to divert the forces reshaping the technology industry and undercutting the company’s business.

Gen.
