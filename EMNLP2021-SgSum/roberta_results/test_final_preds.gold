– Shelly Sterling plans "eventually" to divorce her estranged husband Donald, she tells Barbara Walters at ABC News.<q> As for her stake in the Los Angeles Clippers, she plans to keep it, the AP notes.<q> Sterling says she would "absolutely" fight any NBA decision to force her to sell the team.<q> The team is her "legacy" to her family, she says.<q> "To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners … said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband?<q> Or would they leave the husband in?"
– The unemployment rate dropped to 8.2% last month, but the economy only added 120,000 jobs, when 203,000 new jobs had been predicted, according to today's jobs report.<q> Reaction on the Wall Street Journal's MarketBeat Blog was swift: "Woah!!!<q> Bad number."<q> The unemployment rate, however, is better news; it had been expected to hold steady at 8.3%.<q> But the AP notes that the dip is mostly due to more Americans giving up on seeking employment.
– Tucker Carlson is in deep doodoo with conservative women after an ill-advised tweet referencing Sarah Palin that he posted, then removed, Monday night.<q> "Palin's popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander of Milfistan," he tweeted—and we probably don't need to tell you where that is.<q> His first attempt at an apology, which he tweeted the next morning: "Apparently Charlie Sheen got control of my Twitter account last night while I was at dinner.<q> Apologies for his behavior.” That wasn't good enough for many conservative women, Politico notes, rounding up reactions from bloggers to Michelle Malkin calling his behavior sexist and misogynistic.<q> By late Tuesday, Carlson had offered up a more sincere-sounding apology: “I’m sorry for last night’s tweet.<q> I meant absolutely no offense.<q> Not the first dumb thing I’ve said.<q> Hopefully the last.” But at least one man—Erick Erickson, editor of RedState.com—was on Carlson's side, tweeting his reaction to the post in question: "I laughed then got out my passport."
– A twin-engine Embraer jet that the FAA describes as "on approach to Runway 14" at the Montgomery County Airpark in Gaithersburg, Maryland, crashed into a home this morning, engulfing that home in flames and setting two others on fire.<q> Three people are dead, but the count could grow.<q> A Montgomery County Fire rep says three fliers were killed in the crash, but notes the corporate plane may have had a fourth person on board, reports the AP.<q> A relative of the owner of the home that was hit tells WUSA 9 that a mother with three children pre-school age and under should have been home at the time; there's no word on the family's whereabouts.<q> The crash occurred around 11am on Drop Forge Lane, and the fire was extinguished within an hour.<q> Crews are now searching the wreckage.<q> A witness noted the plane appeared to "wobble" before the crash; the airport is no more than 3/4 mile from the crash scene.<q> NTSB and FAA will investigate.
– What are the three most horrifying words in the English language?<q> Wrong.<q> The correct answer is "amateur testicle surgery."<q> The BBC reports 56-year-old Allan Matthews pleaded guilty Wednesday to removing another man's left testicle at an Australian motel despite not being qualified to practice medicine.<q> The unsanctioned surgery took place in May after a 52-year-old man posted an ad online seeking help for a medical issue, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.<q> The man was apparently still suffering after being kicked in the groin by a horse years earlier but couldn't afford an actual doctor.<q> A week after Matthews allegedly removed the man's testicle, infection set in.<q> The man went to the hospital, and the police launched an investigation.<q> Authorities say a raid of Matthews' home last month turned up medical equipment, seven guns, and four bottles of what may be amyl nitrate.<q> In addition to performing surgery without being a doctor, Matthews also pleaded guilty to gun and drug charges.<q> He did not plead guilty to inflicting "reckless grievous bodily harm."<q> AAP reports Matthews is out on bail until another hearing next month.<q> (An Oregon man claimed surgery left him with an 80-pound scrotum.)
– The US and China have settled on a new round of sanctions against North Korea, and Pyongyang is responding by ratcheting up its usual bluster, threatening to cancel the 1953 ceasefire that ended the Korean War if sanctions go forward and US-South Korean military drills that began March 1 continue.<q> Specifically, the North is warning of "surgical strikes at any time" and a "precision nuclear striking tool" that will seek to "advance our long-cherished wish for national reunification," reports the AP.<q> The US-China deal is aimed at punishing Pyongyang over February's nuclear test, in a joint deal that heads to the UN Security Council today.<q> In addition to new sanctions—whose specifics aren't yet known—the planned resolution enforces current ones, the Wall Street Journal reports.<q> Right now, sanctions include a ban on ballistic missile and nuclear tests and a ban on the import of arms and luxury goods; some in the country face financial and travel restrictions, and the new measures could expand them.<q> China was expected, however, to refuse an oil embargo, believing that such a blow to the North Korean economy could bring refugees to China.<q> The sanctions deal is expected to be adopted this week, says a diplomat.
– Paul Gonzales' approach to dating is similar to that of many men.<q> He meets women online and invites them out to dinner.<q> But here's where he allegedly diverges: According to CBS Los Angeles, 44-year-old Gonzales has been dining and dashing at area restaurants, leaving behind unsuspecting women he's asked out on blind dates.<q> CBS reported in August that Gonzales had left two women to pay the bill after walking out on restaurant dates last summer.<q> One of the women described how he'd eaten $100 worth of food at a restaurant in Long Beach—explaining he had to order two entrees because he's a bodybuilder—before saying he was going to the bathroom.<q> She never saw him again.<q> Now, the man Grub Street identifies as perhaps "the world's worst dinner date" appears to have struck again.<q> A woman, identified by WTOL as Beth, says she met "Dave Gonzales" on Bumble before agreeing to dinner at a restaurant in Pasadena.<q> Gonzales ordered "a glass of pinot, a Caesar salad with a side of shrimp, a steak, and a baked potato" and ate most of the meal before excusing himself to take a phone call, Beth says.<q> He never returned, a text went unanswered, and his Bumble profile was later removed, adds Beth, who soon after learned of Gonzales' alleged notoriety.<q> She says she wants his "disgusting" ruse to stop.<q> According to police, Gonzales has also walked out of a salon, still clad in a smock, without paying for a haircut and color.<q> He's wanted on two bench warrants as a result of misdemeanor charges, including petty theft.<q> (This blind date was more shocking.)
– He was the world's first and surely last "gummi bear magnate," as the headline in Der Spiegel puts it.<q> Hans Riegel, who ran Germany's Haribo candy company and made the chewy little bears a worldwide phenomenon, has died at age 90.<q> The bears were a concoction of his father, the founder of Haribo, but it was the younger Riegel whose deft marketing turned them into a global hit.<q> (Gummi trivia: The jellied bears were originally made of licorice, notes the New York Times.)<q> Riegel and his brother first sold them as "gold bears" in 1960s before changing the name.<q> They introduced them throughout Europe in the 1970s and then set up Haribo of America in Baltimore in the early 1980s.<q> It all paid off: Forbes says the company's revenues are north of $3 billion today.<q> "I just wanted to make something of my father's life work," Riegel once said.
– Five men have been found guilty in the 2006 slaying of 48-year-old Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, whose investigative reporting criticized President Vladimir Putin, the war in Chechnya, and Chechen leadership.<q> Three of the men are brothers from Chechnya, one of whom has been found guilty of the shooting itself, which NBC News reports took place "execution-style" in the elevator of her apartment building.<q> The other two brothers were found guilty of tracking Politkovskaya and acting as getaway drivers, and their uncle and a retired police officer were found to have organized and prepared for the murder, respectively.<q> All face life in prison.<q> Three of the conspirators now convicted were acquitted in 2009, but a retrial was ordered.<q> Another ex-cop was convicted of supplying the murder weapon last year, the BBC reports.<q> The defendants' lawyers plan to appeal the convictions, Reuters reports.<q> Politkovskaya’s family is disappointed that it's still not clear who ordered the killing, saying in a statement that the men convicted "are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice."<q> Though an investigation into the murder continues, critics suggest the mastermind will never be found because, as Reuters puts it, "the trail could lead too close to the government"—Politkovskaya's work angered quite a few important people.
– Education Secretary John King has a message for states where physical discipline is permitted in schools, per USA Today: Quit it.<q> In a letter to governors and state school chiefs, King says 22 states—mostly in the South and West—still allow corporal punishment or don't forbid it.<q> He implores them to stop the "harmful" and "ineffective" practice, saying it teaches kids that getting physical is OK to solve problems.<q> He also points out that some corporal punishment taking place in schools would be considered criminal assault or battery in real-world settings.<q> About 80 groups—including the NAACP—lent their support to a similar letter penned Monday by the National Women's Law Center, reports CBS News.<q> "Corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it's time we do the same for our nation's schoolchildren," an NWLC rep says.<q> King also notes that physical punishment isn't applied equitably to all students.<q> For example, even though black students make up about 16% of attendees in public elementary and secondary schools, they're on the receiving end of one-third of the corporal punishment.<q> Boys are subjected to 80% of such acts, while students with disabilities also tend to be victims more so than other students.<q> "These data and disparities shock the conscience," King writes.<q> (Alabama paddled 19K students in one school year.)
– The Boston Globe has suspended columnist Kevin Cullen without pay for three months after inconsistencies were found in his remarks following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.<q> Per the AP, newspaper publisher John Henry and editor Brian McGrory announced Friday an independent review found Cullen likely fabricated some anecdotes he shared in interviews after the bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds more.<q> The review also noted an uncorrected error in one of Cullen's marathon bombing columns but didn't find signs of fabrication in other works.<q> Cullen, who was part of the Globe team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2014, didn't immediately comment, but Henry and McGrory say he has apologized.<q> Cullen has been on paid leave since April, when Boston sports radio station WEEI noted inconsistencies in Cullen's work and the paper launched its investigation.<q> Per the New York Times, Cullen described in an interview the tale of a firefighter he claimed to have spoken with.<q> He said the firefighter described rescuing a 7-year-old girl whose lower leg had been blown off.<q> However, the firefighter denied having ever spoken to Cullen.<q> The Times also says Cullen, while speaking on a panel in 2013, claimed he witnessed a firefighter outside a bar on the phone with a fellow firefighter, who was apparently traumatized by the bombing, to come out for the night.<q> The Globe has called the account "problematic" and calls into question whether it occurred at all.<q> "Our review also leads us to believe that Mr. Cullen did not commit irrevocable damage," the Globe said in a statement Saturday.<q> "He has also acknowledged his failures and the issues they have created."
– A deadly E. coli outbreak in Europe linked to tainted cucumbers and other vegetables is getting worse, report the Wall Street Journal and AP: The toll: Sixteen people are dead (15 in Germany and one woman in Sweden who had just traveled to Germany); more than 1,000 people are sick in Germany alone, with 373 having the most serious form of E. coli.<q> Hundreds more cases are reported throughout Europe.<q> The source: Germany blames cucumbers from Spain, specifically the Almeria and Malaga regions.<q> A third batch from the Netherlands or Denmark is under investigation.<q> Spain angrily denies being the source, and EU officials say the vegetables could have become tainted anywhere along the supply chain.<q> The fallout: Russia has banned some imports from Spain and Germany (and may expand it to all EU nations); Italy, Austria, and other nations have stopped short of that but are ramping up inspections at supermarkets.
– Portugal is biting the bullet and admitting that it desperately needs a massive bailout from its European Union partners to stay afloat.<q> Caretaker prime minister Jose Socrates told the nation that the decision to seek a bailout was "a last resort" as interest rates on its short-term debt skyrocket, reports the Guardian.<q> Analysts believe the bailout will cost the EU some $114 billion.<q> Portugal, which will have to commit to an economic adjustment program in exchange for the funds, joins Ireland and Greece on the eurozone's casualty list.<q> The bailout request was widely expected, and analysts see it as a positive move because it will prevent a Portuguese collapse that could have made Spain the next target for markets searching for signs of weakness.<q> "This is good news.<q> We've been saying for a while that Portugal's finances were not sustainable at these rates," a Goldman Sachs economist tells Reuters.<q> "We think the contagion stops here."
– The tornado threat isn't over: "Large and devastating" storms could continue today, forecasters say.<q> "We could have a Round 3," says a CNN meteorologist.<q> "Hopefully, it won't be as bad."<q> But "tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail" could hit areas east and south of Oklahoma City, with cities from Dallas to Little Rock also at risk, says a Weather Channel forecaster.<q> Some 9.5 million people could face further major tornadoes, a forecaster tells MSNBC, while CNN says 53 million could see severe weather today.<q> Areas from Dallas to Shreveport face the biggest danger "from mid-afternoon to late evening hours," says another CNN expert.<q> Storms could also strike "from the Great Lakes across the Mississippi River Valley and into central Texas," according to the National Weather Service.<q> The threat moves further eastward tomorrow, "although the overall severity appears to be lower," adds a Weather Channel expert.<q> Click for more.
– Apparently New York in flames was not enough.<q> Now a quasi-official North Korean news agency has posted a new video—this one of the US Capitol exploding, NBC News reports.<q> Intercut with images of North Korean artillery and missiles, the video also shows a target homing in on the White House.<q> "The White House is caught in the panoramic sight of a long-range missile," reads a caption.<q> "This hotbed of war is in the scope of a nuclear bomb blow."<q> The video comes after months of alarming moves by Pyongyang.<q> The North has tested a rocket and a nuclear weapon, threatened to nuke the US, and announced the end of the armistice that has kept peace on the Korean peninsula.<q> One analyst blames the escalation on new leader Kim Jong Un's need to "prove himself" to North Korea's military: "My take is that it is overwhelmingly bluster for domestic reasons, not international ones," she says.<q> (Click to see the video of New York being firebombed, accompanied by an instrumental version of "We Are the World.")
– Tarzan had his Jane, and so, too, will Johnnie.<q> Thanks to the "Me Too" and "Time's Up" movements, gender equality is gaining new awareness in the workplace, and now perhaps in your whisky: TMZ reports that Diageo, parent company of the Johnnie Walker brand, put in the paperwork earlier this month for a Jane Walker trademark that would cover a bevy of unspecified beverages.<q> A post at Drampedia notes that labels bearing the name "Jane Walker Edition" have turned up, but no details are available on any new products.<q> "Whether it’s Johnnie’s sister or not will be revealed in due time," per the post.<q> It appears this isn't the first time the female-monikered concept, which TMZ assumes will focus on "gender equality and female empowerment," has been broached by Diageo.<q> Adweek noted right after the 2016 presidential election that a Jane Walker ad campaign was in the works, but it was apparently nixed after Hillary Clinton lost, sources said at the time.
– To anyone born after 1995, the floppy disk is better known as that thing that resembles the "save" icon.<q> To the Pentagon, it's the gizmo that controls America's nukes.<q> A report from the Government Accountability Office finds US government agencies spend $60 billion a year operating and maintaining outdated systems—three times more than is spent on upgrades, per CNN.<q> One such system: the Pentagon's IBM Series-1 computer which uses 8-inch floppy disks "in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces," including intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombers.<q> For youngsters, the big floppy disks were the precursor to the 3.5-inch ones, before the CD came around.<q> "This system remains in use because, in short, it still works," a Pentagon rep tells the AFP, per the BBC, which notes you'd need 130,000 8-inch floppy disks to get the storage capacity of a 32GB memory stick.<q> "However, to address obsolescence concerns, the floppy drives are scheduled to be replaced with secure digital devices by the end of 2017," the rep says.<q> Other system upgrades are expected by 2020.<q> "Maybe we'll have Nintendo Gameboys controlling our nukes by the next presidential election," quips CNN's Jake Tapper.<q> The Treasury, Commerce, and Veteran Affairs departments should also look into upgrading.<q> The report finds all three use computer code introduced in the 1950s, per the Verge.<q> (Floppy disks are partly to blame for lost scientific data.)
– Calls to suicide hotlines have spiked dramatically since the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain—not an unusual phenomenon in the wake of celebrity suicides.<q> The Wall Street Journal reports on a 25% uptick at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) since Spade's death, while USA Today attributed a similar rise to both celebs, and a New Jersey hotline experienced a 70% increase in calls Friday morning.<q> "We're so extremely busy," says Rachel Larkin, who heads a crisis-prevention center in Maryland.<q> "I think we’re all worried.<q>...<q> Both Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain are people a lot of people related to."<q> Celebrity suicides have been linked to suicide increases before.<q> Marilyn Monroe's 1962 death, for example, preceded a 12% spike in suicides nationwide, the Wrap reports.<q> "When people who have suicidal thoughts see seemingly happy, famous and wealthy people dying of suicide, it makes them feel more hopeless," says Lauren Foster, who heads a hotline in Raleigh, North Carolina.<q> "They think if they died, what’s to stop me?"<q> But suicide-prevention advocates are emphasizing that hotlines do help and people's calls will go through, despite the surge this week.<q> Check out Buzzfeed to learn what happens on hotline calls and see what resources are available.
– A big win for Samsung in its long-running patent feud with Apple: The US International Trade Commission has banned imports of the AT&T models of older Apple products including the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 3G after deciding Apple violated a Samsung patent, the Wall Street Journal reports.<q> Newer Apple products like the iPhone 5 are not affected by the ruling, which Apple says it is "disappointed" by and will appeal.<q> The ruling will take effect in 60 days unless it is vetoed by President Obama, a move analysts say is nearly as unlikely as the two companies deciding to settle their difference amicably.<q> "There’s too much skin in the game now," a spokesman for technology research firm IDC tells Bloomberg.<q> "It’s almost so ugly I don’t think they’ll come to any agreement.<q> Both companies have a lot of cash and are generating a lot of money.<q> It’s not like they have to worry about paying the legal bills."
– Dr. Sherwin Nuland, whose book How We Die sparked national debate over end-of-life decisions, has died from prostate cancer at his Connecticut home.<q> The 83-year-old surgeon's award-winning 1994 book on death argued that death with dignity was rare and doctors too often tried to prolong life when further treatment was futile, the New York Times reports.<q> "I have not seen much dignity in the process by which we die," he wrote.<q> "The quest to achieve true dignity fails when our bodies fail."<q> In a 1996 interview, he said he hoped he would go "without suffering and surrounded by loved ones" when it was his time.<q> His daughter says he often spoke to his family about his illness and impending death and while he was very much at peace most of the time, there were times of sadness and fear toward the end.<q> "He wasn’t scared of death itself, but he loved everything about his world and the people in his world and life,” she tells the AP.<q> "And he didn’t want to leave."
– Police say a pregnant teenager was shot dead while asleep in a southern Arizona home early Saturday, but that doctors were able to deliver her unborn child.<q> 19-year-old Jasmine Vega was found unconscious by officers responding to a 911 call from inside the residence, Fox News reports.<q> Vega was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead, but doctors managed to save her son.<q> "Hospital staff [was] able to successfully deliver her unborn child, who is currently being treated at the hospital," Tucson Police Department wrote on Facebook.<q> Per Tucson News Now, the child’s father, Anthony Rivera, says the baby boy is in critical condition and on life support.<q> Vega was six months pregnant, and loved ones described her to Tucson News Now as “kind, compassionate, and so excited to be a mom.” No other other occupants were injured during the shooting.<q> Authorities say multiple gunshots were fired toward the home from outside, and that there were several bullet holes found in the walls, but it is still unknown whether the gunfire was targeted specifically at anyone in the household.<q> Tucson police are asking for anyone with information to come forward.<q> “You can remain anonymous,” they said on Facebook.<q> (Three St. Louis women were killed as they tried to escape a home invasion.)
– Public apologies making headlines this week include a scientist and a senator trying to show how funny they are: Prize winner: "I'm really, really sorry I caused any offense, that's awful.<q> I certainly didn't mean that.<q> I just meant to be honest, actually.<q> "—Tim Hunt, Nobel-winning scientist, after he made light of "girls" working in labs.<q> He added that it was a "stupid" thing to say in front of journalists, which is partly why a writer at the Washington Post calls this the "non-apology of the year."<q> New name, please: "We are sorry that wording which could be considered offensive has been used, as this has not been our intention at all.<q> "—Lego, after it described a strange-looking new Lego model as a "window-licker," a derogatory term for people with learning disabilities.<q> If it's on Facebook, it must be true: "I want to apologize as well to all our listeners for having made an erroneous statement.<q> I am sorry for the mistake.<q> However, I am glad to play a role in putting this rumor to rest.<q> "—Diane Rehm of NPR, after she informed Bernie Sanders that he had Israeli citizenship during an interview.<q> He doesn't.<q> She had seen it on Facebook.<q> Unsportsmanslike: "We apologize to all fans watching the game on television, to both teams and to our guests from Italy for the Nazi symbol.<q> "—Tomislav Pacak, a Croatian Football Federation spokesman, referring to the faint but unmistakable imprint of a large swastika on a soccer field.<q> He's a what?<q> "(He) was joking with his colleague and immediately apologized to anyone offended by his remark.<q> "—Spokesperson for Sen. Mark Kirk, after he described his bachelor colleague Lindsey Graham as a "bro with no ho."<q> (A Sun-Times columnist thinks he owes a specific apology to residents of Chicago's South Side.)<q> All business: "Please accept the apologies from my previous letter, which should not have been sent.<q> "—Homeowners association in Brentwood, Tenn., after threatening to sue a family for putting up a wheelchair ramp.<q> The homeowner, a pastor, just had brain surgery.<q> The HOA had second thoughts when the story went public.
– A day after hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets to call for gun control, an old man used his bully pulpit to urge them to keep shouting, reports Reuters.<q> Speaking at his Palm Sunday Mass, 81-year-old Pope Francis warned that "the temptation to silence young people has always existed," along with ways "to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive."<q> But, reports the AP, he told young people that "It is up to you not to keep quiet.<q> Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, some corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?"<q> The response from the crowd: "Yes!"
– Remember the boundary-busting French satirical newspaper that was firebombed for making the Prophet Mohammed a "guest editor"?<q> Journalists toned down the controversy this time around—not.<q> In fact, right on the cover, a Muslim is planting a big, slobbery kiss on a figure representing the publication, Charlie Hebdo.<q> Above the embrace are the words: "Love is stronger than hate."<q> The Guardian says the paper "isn't holding back," while Gawker—convinced the Muslim is a "gay Mohammad" (though he's not in the garb of the prophet)—calls it the "ballsiest paper in the world."<q> Charlie Hebdo's editor said after the firebombing that "freedom to have a good laugh is as important as freedom of speech."<q> The French, including some Muslim leaders, have strongly supported the publication, which is now operating out of the offices of the left-wing Paris newspaper Liberation.<q> "I am extremely attached to the freedom of the press, even if the press is not always tender with Muslims, Islam, or the Paris Mosque," said the head of the Paris Mosque.
– Since mid-2014, about 75,000 Syrian refugees have been in limbo in the "berm"—what the Guardian describes as the "no-man's land" at the border between Jordan and Syria.<q> And since June of this year, those refugees have been living in what Doctors Without Borders has called "some of the most extreme conditions on Earth," enduring temperatures over the summer that surpassed 120 degrees Fahrenheit and watching humanitarian supplies and food come to a halt in June after Jordan cut off deliveries following a car bomb.<q> But government spokesman Mohammad Momani told the Jordan Times on Sunday that while the borders remain sealed, a new method of delivery will be used: cranes that will lower the goods from the northeastern side of the border to the other side (there was a one-off delivery like this in August).<q> And it sounds like the aid is coming just in time.<q> Per the AP, the refugees are living in tents and suffering not only from hunger and exposure to the elements, but also from serious illness, including whooping cough and hepatitis.<q> Last month, Amnesty International released chilling video footage and satellite images that showed graves and burial mounds in the berm, per the Washington Post.<q> "Many people have died," a refugee living in one of the camps told the group, saying conditions were "awful."<q> "The mood among the people … is below zero."<q> Two anonymous aid officials tell the news agency there's been no final confirmation, but Momani says the plans are being put in place to expedite the deliveries.<q> "The aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly," he says, noting the aid groups will make the call on the pace of the deliveries.<q> (One star offered comfort to refugees: Lindsay Lohan.)
– Teens aren't necessarily as in love with social media as they're portrayed to be.<q> The results of an AP poll released last week show that nearly 60% of teens in the US have taken social media breaks—most of the time voluntary ones that last at least a week.<q> Now researchers at the University of South Wales have presented findings to the British Psychological Society that suggest even what are perceived to be straightforward perks of social media—such as getting attention via likes—may not exactly elevate the end user's mood.<q> "Although this is just a relatively small-scale study, the results indicate that the ways we interact with social media can affect how we feel, and not always positively," one researcher says.<q> To test this, the team reports in a Science Daily news release that it recruited 340 participants on Twitter and Facebook to complete personality questionnaires and then agree or disagree with 25 statements.<q> Key findings include that people who go out of their way to rack up more likes tend to have low self-esteem and be less trusting of others, and that those likes don't actually lift their mood or how they see themselves.<q> Previous research has looked not at more likes, but at more time, reports Medical Daily.<q> It cites a study published in 2016 that surveyed 19- to 32-year-olds and found "individuals in the highest quartile of [social media] site visits per week... had significantly increased odds of depression."<q> (Young people average at least an hour a day on social media.)
– Anyone whose luggage has been lost by an airline now has a patron saint in the form of Justice Peter Smith in Britain.<q> When lawyers for British Airways showed up in his court to argue a $4.6 billion price-fixing case, Smith had smaller fish to fry: He wanted to know why the airline lost his luggage on a recent trip to Italy, reports the Legal Cheek blog.<q> The questioning of BA counsel Jon Turner is priceless, as relayed by the Independent: "Mr Turner, here is a question for you.<q> What happened to [the] luggage?” When Turner replies that they're actually in court for a different matter, Smith won't be put off: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?” Turner again tries to deflect the questioning, but Smith responds, “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question: namely, what happened to the luggage?<q> It has been two weeks since that happened now."<q> This goes on for a while, and the BA lawyers ask Smith to recuse himself from the case they're supposed to be arguing because he's biased.<q> Smith reluctantly agrees to do so.<q> Entertaining yes, but whether it was good judgeship remains to be seen—the Times of London reports that judicial conduct authorities are investigating.<q> The same judge once inserted a secret message ("Smithy Code") into his ruling in a copyright case involving the Da Vinci Code, notes the Telegraph.<q> (If you'd like to be berated by an American judge, try this.)
– Fans of The Simpsons who thought they'd be yelling "Doh!"<q> last night were ranting "Dud!"<q> this morning.<q> Viewers had been warned for months that what was rumored to be a major character would be killed off during the premiere of the show's 26th season last night, the Los Angeles Times reports.<q> There was a character who kicked the cartoon bucket, but it wasn't exactly a major one: It was Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, Krusty the Clown's dad, voiced by comedian Jackie Mason, a character that only appeared in "a handful" of episodes, the Times notes.<q> Reaction to the "Clown in the Dumps" episode ranged from mild, NPR-style disappointment to outright irritation: Tim Donnelly writes in the New York Post that the death (and preceding teasers) were "a lame play for attention by a show desperate to stay relevant."<q> One Twitter user quoted in the Times complained, "Krusty's dad died... Um, Krusty had a Dad?<q> Never heard of him.<q> Wasted anticipation."<q> Producer Al Jean insists he has always said the untimely death was "overhyped" and that he never promised it would be one of the more-popular characters.<q> "I never said it’s an iconic character—I never used those words," he tells Entertainment Weekly.<q> In fact, he assures fans that favorites will never be purposely annihilated before series' end.<q> "We're never going to kill off Homer, or even Krusty," he tells TVLine.<q> "This show is always running in syndication, and we don't want you to feel bad every time you see an old character that you loved."
– One of your vices could one day be a little more virtuous: Scientists are today announcing that they've figured out how to make chocolate healthier.<q> The findings will be detailed by researchers from Belgium's Ghent University and the University of Ghana at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver, and center around how antioxidant-rich the sweet is.<q> As a press release explains, it all comes down to tweaking the process.<q> Cocoa beans are removed from pods, fermented in baskets, sun-dried, and then roasted.<q> It's during that last step, the roasting, that polyphenols, which act as antioxidants, are partially lost.<q> In a bid to up the polyphenol content, researchers added a nontraditional step that "makes our research fundamentally different," explains Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa: pulp preconditioning.<q> That simply means they stored the pods—in the case of their experiments, for zero, three, seven, or 10 days—before removing the beans and beginning the fermentation process.<q> A sweet pulp rests between the pod and the beans, and Afoakwa believes the preconditioning gives the pulp time to affect those beans.<q> Indeed, the researchers found that those stored for a week showed the highest antioxidant activity after roasting—which they also adjusted.<q> Rather than heat the beans for the typical 10 to 20 minutes at 248-266 degrees, they lowered the temp to 242 and upped the roasting time to 45 minutes, and discovered that slower and lower was also best in terms of antioxidant activity.<q> The researchers' abstract notes another benefit: "Pulp preconditioning and roasting duration could be used to reduce the astringency and bitterness," improving chocolate's flavor.<q> (Also presented at the ACS meeting: what's really in your pot.)
– The US stands by the "one-China" policy, but that doesn't mean it can't sell weapons directly to Taiwan, citing ithe Taiwan Relations Act to ensure Taiwan can adequately defend itself—and China isn't happy about it.<q> The Obama administration announced a $1.8 billion arms package sale to Congress on Wednesday, Reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and $416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies.<q> The announcement came amid reports that the US had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from China, which still claims Taiwan as a territory, per the Wall Street Journal.<q> Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters.<q> China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and "severely" damages China's sovereignty.<q> "China's government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies," a ministry spokesman says.<q> A Pentagon spokesman gave the equivalent of an eyeroll Wednesday, per the New York Times, noting, "The Chinese can react to this as they see fit.<q> … It's a [clear-eyed], sober view of an assessment of Taiwan's defense needs.<q> … There's no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with China."<q> Meanwhile, the AP notes that China has issued similar threats before, with "no evidence they've had any meaningful effect."<q> (All this despite a lengthy handshake last month.)
– If you've ever called your boss a "terrible human being," it turns out you sort of have something in common with the president's next acting chief of staff.<q> Mick Mulvaney, who was named as John Kelly's replacement on Friday, used those choice words in reference to Donald Trump one week before the 2016 election.<q> Politico reports Mulvaney was up for re-election in the House (he won), and referred to Trump and Hillary Clinton during a South Carolina debate as "perhaps two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country" when asked whether he was throwing his support behind the GOP candidate.<q> He zeroed in on Trump specifically, saying "Do I like Donald Trump?<q> No" and noting he didn't see Trump as a role model for his sons.<q> And there's this: "Yes, I am supporting Donald Trump, but I’m doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that I think he’s a terrible human being.<q> But the choice on the other side is just as bad."<q> USA Today reports it was only hours after the Mulvaney news broke on Friday that the Daily Beast posted video of those comments.<q> Mulvaney himself had more positive words on Friday, tweeting, "This is a tremendous honor.<q> I look forward to working with the President and the entire team.<q> It’s going to be a great 2019!"<q> (Mulvaney will hold onto his other jobs in the administration.)
– A massive leak of fracking fluid poured into the streets of Arlington, Texas, two months ago and forced the evacuation of a hundred homes.<q> Now city officials have taken Vantage Energy to task for its "unacceptable" handling of the 43,000-gallon spill, WFAA reports.<q> During a city council meeting yesterday, it emerged that Vantage had taken nearly two hours to call 911 despite the risk of a gas leak.<q> "This is unacceptable behavior," says an Arlington city council member.<q> According to Fire Chief Don Crowson, the two-hour delay was no joke: "We’re not kidding around about the 911 issue," he tells the Star-Telegram during a break in city council.<q> "It could have ended in a bad outcome.<q> Two hours’ advance notice could have helped a lot."<q> Still, officials say the environmental damage was not extensive and Vantage has been cooperative.<q> So what happened, exactly?<q> According to the city's report, a Vantage well site sprung a leak on April 11, which allowed fracking water and chemicals to boil up into Arlington's streets, storm sewers, and streams.<q> Because the fracking fluid had been fracturing shale and freeing gas under high pressure, natural gas could have leaked at any time.<q> Now WFAA says a 1,500-gallon spill occurred at the same location a month before, and NBC-Dallas/Fort Worth reports that the site is close to reopening.<q> "I just assumed this was a residential area and it would be free from industrial hazardous operations," says a resident after hearing about the earlier spill.<q> "Now we see it's not."
– In March, Ki’ari Pope drank boiling water through a straw after she and her cousin watched a video of someone appearing to do it on YouTube and her cousin dared her to try.<q> Early Monday, the Florida 8-year-old was pronounced dead after months of medical issues related to the tragic stunt.<q> Ki'ari underwent emergency surgery to clear scar tissue on her windpipe so she could breathe; after the tracheotomy, she continued to have difficulty breathing (requiring two trips to the ER) and also talking.<q> She had a doctor's appointment set for Friday to be checked.<q> But on Sunday night, she told her mother's boyfriend she was struggling to breathe; she lost consciousness within minutes and was pronounced dead about an hour later, at 12:15am Monday, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.<q> The Medical Examiner's Office is still determining Ki'ari's cause of death, and Florida's Department of Children and Families is investigating the incident.<q> There have been at least 10 other DCF cases related to the family since 2008, the Palm Beach Post reports, five of them involving alleged domestic violence between Ki'ari's mother and her boyfriend; it's not clear whether the boyfriend who called 911 after Ki'ari lost consciousness is the same one from those reports.<q> At least one of the DCF cases resulted in verified proof of abuse or neglect, but details aren't available.<q> DCF isn't saying whether the girl's mother or other family members are under investigation, but a woman identifying herself as the mother's cousin says DCF officials took Ki'ari's three siblings away Thursday.<q> Ki'ari's family is raising money to go toward funeral costs on GoFundMe.
– Researchers think they've found a promising new potential weapon in the fight against malaria in a fairly unlikely place: the blood of toddlers.<q> In a paper published in Science today, researchers detail how they examined the blood of more than 750 children in Tanzania.<q> They found that about 6% of those children had an antibody against one of the disease's key proteins, and that those children didn't suffer from severe malaria.<q> Researchers think they can make a vaccine patterned on their blood, Paul Rodgers at Forbes explains.<q> Until now, most malaria vaccines have focused on keeping the disease out of the red blood cells it reproduces in.<q> But this antibody is unique in that it instead attacks the protein that allows the parasite to escape the cells.<q> "We're sort of trapping the parasite in the burning house," says co-lead author Jonathan Kurtis—who suffered his own bout of malaria while studying in Kenya while in college, NPR reports.<q> The team believes this approach could work in concert with existing vaccines.<q> It's a refreshing, promising idea, one Harvard doctor says, though she cautions that "this is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans."<q> It's been trialed in mice and will soon be tested on monkeys.
– The last unemployment report before the midterms is a strong one.<q> Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, above the forecast of 188,000, reports the Wall Street Journal.<q> The unemployment rate itself remained at a five-decade low of 3.7%, per the AP.<q> The influx of new job-seekers in October increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009.<q> What's more, wages rose 3.1% when compared to last October, the best such gain since 2009.<q> It's the first time since the recession ended that wages rose more than 3% over a year.<q> Average hourly earnings in the private sector increased 5 cents to $27.30.
– Prosecutors have all but nixed James Holmes' reported offer of a guilty plea to dodge the death penalty.<q> They're "extremely unlikely" to accept the proposal without "specific access to information" on Holmes that, so far, his team has refused to provide, they say, per the Denver Post.<q> What's more, "there is not—and has never been—an actual or unqualified 'offer' to plead guilty," prosecutors wrote in an angry filing yesterday accusing Holmes' team of a misleading publicity stunt.<q> The prosecutors' filing, signed by district attorney George Brauchler himself rather than a deputy, also took issue with defense suggestions about a lengthy series of pretrial hearings, among other concerns.<q> Brauchler accused the defense of "an attempt to deliberately prejudice the public, witnesses, and victims against the People."<q> Meanwhile, he called on the judge to reject a defense motion calling for action against the prosecution for allegedly leaking information to the press.<q> Brauchler is poised to announce whether he'll seek the death penalty on Monday.
– Syria's new constitution was backed by more than 89% of voters, the nation's Interior Ministry announced today, even as violence continues to rage across the country and the West decries the referendum as a sham.<q> The Interior Ministry claims that more than 57% of Syria's 14 million eligible voters turned out, with about 9% voting no and 1.6% of the ballots being rejected as spoiled.<q> The New York Times notes that the Syrian government controlled the voting, but may not have needed to manipulate the results, considering that much of the opposition boycotted the referendum.<q> Across the nation, 33 people were killed today, many of them in continued government shelling in Homs, and 55 people died yesterday.<q> The European Union has imposed new sanctions in the face of the continuing violence, CNN reports.<q> Seven ministers of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, as well as the Syrian Central Bank, will have their EU assets frozen.<q> The ministers will also be denied entry into the EU and Syrian cargo flights will not be allowed to use EU airports.<q> Says the EU foreign policy chief in a statement, "As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions."
– Rep. Darrell Issa is proposing a bill that would "create a two-year moratorium on any new laws, rules, or regulations governing the Internet," reports CNN.<q> It's been met with some controversy from fellow politicians and the public alike.<q> The bill could block regulations that protect consumer privacy, says one lawmaker, and may stymie President Obama's efforts to bolster cybersecurity, reports The Hill.<q> Issa is hosting a Q&A on Reddit today to discuss his bill, and plans to adjust it after receiving feedback.<q> A separate battle is happening in Washington over the 'Do Not Track' initiative, which aims to give Internet users the ability to stop the collection of personal information for advertising purposes.<q> It's a tough topic, since online ads are what pay for many free services, reports the Washington Post.<q> The initiatives looked set to move forward after a successful White House event in February, but since then talks have grown bitter, in part due to opposition from advertising groups.<q> The co-chair of the committee working on the initiative announced she'd be stepping down today, which could help revive talks.
– The nine people shot to death in a South Carolina church last night ranged in age from 26 to 87, reports NBC News.<q> Some details about them: The Rev.<q> Clementa Pinckney, 41.<q> The married father of two was a pastor at Emanuel AME and a state senator.<q> "He was the moral compass of the state Senate," a colleague said on CNN, per Mother Jones Tywanza Sanders, 26.<q> He had graduated from Allen University with a degree in business administration just last year.<q> The school called him a "quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education."<q> Cynthia Hurd, 54.<q> She was a longtime employee of the Charleston County Public Library.<q> All branches were closed today in her honor.<q> Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 49, worked at Goose Creek High School as a speech therapist and girls' track coach.<q> She was also a pastor at the church.<q> The Rev.<q> Depayne Middelton Doctor, 49, a church singer who had worked for Charleston County providing services for the poor.<q> She was a mother of four.<q> Susie Jackson, 87, a longtime member of the historic church.<q> Ethel Lance, 70, a church sexton who had worked at Emanuel AME for three decades.<q> The Rev.<q> Daniel Simmons, 74, was on the church's ministerial staff, attending Sunday services and a weekly Bible study.<q> Myra Thompson, 59, was the wife of the vicar of Holy Trinity Reformed Episcopal Church in Charleston.<q> Suspect Dylann Roof was arrested after a woman spotted him driving.)
– Danish toy maker Lego will cut 1,400 jobs, or about 8% of its global workforce, after reporting a decline in sales and profits in the first half of 2017.<q> The privately held company said Tuesday that its revenue dropped 5% to $2.4 billion in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of weakness in established markets like the US and Europe.<q> Profits slipped 3% to $544 million.<q> "We are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this," said Chairman Joergen Vig Knudstorp, per the AP.<q> He said the long-term aim is to reach "more children in our well-established markets in Europe and the United States," and added there were "strong growth opportunities in growing markets such as China."<q> The company, he said, needs to simplify its business model to reduce costs, though details weren't immediately available on what that might mean.<q> Since 2012, the group has built an increasingly complex organization to support global double-digit growth.<q> However, "in the process, we have added complexity into the organization which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further," Vig Knudstorp said.<q> The company has been lauded for embracing the digital era through smartphone apps and tie-ins with movies and video games, notes Reuters.<q> The maker of the famous colored building blocks has more than 19,000 employees around the world.
– If tour bus company owner-driver Teodulo Elias Vides hadn't been one of 13 people killed in a horrific crash on Interstate 10 near Palm Springs, Calif., on Sunday, authorities would probably have some tough questions for him.<q> Authorities say half the tires on the bus he was driving, including both steer axle tires, were worn down to an unsafe level, which would have been enough for inspectors to take the bus out of service, the AP reports.<q> The bus, which was on its way to Los Angeles from the Red Earth Casino in Salton Sea Beach, plowed into the back of a big rig and it's not clear whether Vides attempted to brake first.<q> The full National Transportation Safety Board investigation could take up to a year.<q> Vides, 59, had been sued twice for negligence over incidents involving his USA Holiday company, which is listed as having just one bus, the Los Angeles Times reports.<q> In a 2007 incident, three people died when a USA Holiday bus hit a Honda Civic on a freeway in Riverside, Calif.<q> The company also received at least six "unsatisfactory" ratings from the California Highway Patrol for issues including maintenance, and Vides had several traffic citations on his record.<q> The victims, whose ages range from 50 to 72, were mostly seated near the front of the bus, reports the Press Enterprise.<q> Another 31 people were injured.
– One familiar face who apparently won't be appearing at Spock's funeral: Kirk.<q> William Shatner tweeted today that he "can't make it" to Leonard Nimoy's memorial service tomorrow because he's currently in Florida doing charity work, Gawker reports.<q> Noting that he had "agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight," Shatner added: "I feel really awful.<q> Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried."<q> He suggested an online event tomorrow instead.<q> "Maybe tomorrow we come together here and celebrate his life," he wrote.
– President Obama's aunt Zeituni Onyango, an illegal immigrant living in public housing, is unapologetic about her situation and says her nephew hasn't been helping her fight to stay in the US.<q> An immigration judge granted her asylum this year.<q> "Obama did not know my whereabouts," the Kenyan native tells WBZ, the CBS affiliate in Boston, where she lives.<q> "If I come as an immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen."<q> In a rambling, sometimes combative interview, Onyango says, "I didn't take any advantage of the system.<q> The system took advantage of me."<q> She says she arrived in the US in 2000, fell ill, and couldn't afford to return home when she left the hospital.<q> "I knew I had overstayed. "<q> Asked whether she wants to become a citizen, she responds, " If I didn't why the hell would I have been here all this time? "
– It appears Lea Michele is beginning to move on, almost a year after the death of her boyfriend Cory Monteith.<q> The Glee actress met Matthew Paetz on the set of one of her music videos in April, and she's reportedly been seeing him, quietly, for a couple months.<q> "For a long time, Lea wasn't close to even thinking about getting into a relationship," a source tells People.<q> "Cory's death was and will continue to be a struggle for her."<q> Paetz is an aspiring actor and model, People notes, and on his Twitter account he describes himself as a dating and lifestyle coach—but TMZ says he is, or was, also a gigolo who went by the name "Christian" on Cowboys4Angels, a site offering male "companionship" that's featured on Showtime's Gigolos.<q> TMZ has a screenshot of "Christian's" profile, which described him as a life coach, dating expert, and massage therapist who charged $350 per hour or $6,000 per weekend, but the gossip site says the profile is now hidden or removed.<q> Sources say Paetz last took a client in April, but has taken a break since he and Michele got together.<q> She was apparently unhappy after TMZ's gigolo story, the site notes in a follow-up, but sources say Paetz told her he really just coaches gigolos, and had only gone out with a few clients, for research purposes.<q> But a TMZ source says Paetz had been working as an escort for nearly a year, and had gone on more than a few outings.<q> But Michele "feels he's a great guy," another source tells E!.<q> "He treats her really well, he's smart and fun.<q> She's really happy."
– The US commandos who tried to rescue American Luke Somers in Yemen came agonizingly close to doing so, according to an account in the Wall Street Journal.<q> It says that about 40 special-ops troops got to within 100 yards of the walled compound in silence about 1am local time.<q> Then, "a noise, maybe a dog bark, alerted the militants to the raiders," writes Adam Entous, who spoke to US officials familiar with the rescue attempt.<q> A 30-minute firefight ensued, during which officials think a militant from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula slipped into the building where Somers was being held and shot him and South African hostage Pierre Korkie.<q> The US troops killed about 10 militants and managed to escape with the two wounded hostages, but one died in the military aircraft carrying him away and the other died on an operating table.<q> "The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology," said President Obama, as per Reuters.<q> Obama approved the raid, the second in two weeks to try to free Somers, after AQAP promised to kill the photojournalist later today.
– As of this morning, 100 of the 183 people hospitalized in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing have been released, CNN reports, in a testament to how well area doctors have handled the crisis.<q> Boston boasts nearly 80 hospitals, and they're regarded as some of the world's best, the Week points out, while MSNBC observes that trauma treatment has improved drastically since 9/11—in part because of America's war experience.<q> The Marathon bombs were IEDs, "and that's exactly what a number of our troops in Iraq in Afghanistan have had to deal with," one emergency room specialist tells NPR.<q> Techniques learned in those conflicts have now proliferated into civilian medicine.<q> Tourniquets, for instance, have gone from being considered a dangerous last resort to a routine life-saver.<q> Shrapnel extraction techniques have improved as well.<q> It also helped that there was a medical tent at the finish line already, which quickly became a well-oiled triage center.<q> "I've seen a lot worse," one emergency room physician tells the New York Times.<q> "They were without question ready—not for those types of injuries, but they were prepared."
– Police searching for a 62-year-old man who disappeared in Australia's Outback on Wednesday say the grandfather has miraculously been found alive.<q> Reg Foggerdy had been last seen near a campsite on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia while on a hunting trip with his brother, reports the Guardian.<q> He had left to shoot a feral camel but never returned, adds the BBC.<q> Though an experienced bushman, he was wearing only a T-shirt, shorts, hat, and flip-flops and had no food or water, police say.<q> Police began a land and air search after discovering a camel carcass and finally discovered fresh tracks on Monday, reports the West Australian.<q> Foggerdy was found "extremely dehydrated, a bit delusional," under a tree Tuesday morning about 9 miles from his last known location.<q> "He's received treatment, first aid on the ground, and it's fair to say he's now sitting up and talking," officer Andy Greatwood tells ABC Radio, adding Foggerdy's "fantastic survival skills" kept him alive when "most people would not have survived."<q> After walking for miles, Foggerdy had spent his last two days in the Outback "lying down under a tree and eating black ants," Greatwood says.<q> Foggerdy's wife, Erlyn, says he may have picked up that tip from a jungle survival show he liked to watch every day, reports PerthNow.<q> Foggerdy's 11-year-old son says he initially wasn't too concerned when his father didn't return to camp, but "when he was lost for a few more days I started getting worried.<q> I'm so happy they found him."<q> Family members add they'll now force Foggerdy, who's recovering in a hospital, to carry a satellite phone.<q> (A dad's survival tip kept this lost boy alive.)
– Life vest, check.<q> Adult supervision, check.<q> She should have been safe, but a freak accident in a New Jersey lagoon took the life of an 11-year-old girl over the weekend.<q> Police say the girl was electrocuted while swimming and playing on an inflatable raft behind a friend’s home in Toms River, reports the Asbury Park Press.<q> The girl was with two friends when the incident occurred, and they were all wearing life vests as they swam and rafted in the lagoon under adult supervision, reports PIX11.<q> A police statement says that after the girls touched the rail to a metal boat lift, an "electric current appears to have energized the equipment causing the injury."<q> The girl was administered CPR on the scene, but died later at the hospital.<q> It's not the first time such an accident has been in the news this year.<q> Following the April death of Alabama teen Carmen Johnson, who was shocked while swimming near her family's boathouse, CBS News explained that small levels of electric current in water can serve as a “silent killer,” especially in fresh water, where voltage can “take a shortcut” through bodies.<q> And two more Alabama women are also believed to have been shocked to death in lake water, reports AL.com.<q> The Electric Shock Drowning Prevention Association advises against swimming in or near docks, marinas, and boatyards, while the parents of Johnson offered more tips on TODAY, like using plastic over metal ladders and making sure there is a ground fault breaker at docks.
– There will be no new trips to the Washington Monument for students within Canada's largest school system.<q> The Toronto District School Board, which includes 245,000 students in 584 schools, will no longer green-light trips south of the border, citing uncertainty over border restrictions.<q> "We strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border" in light of President Trump's proposed travel restrictions, TDSB Director of Education John Malloy says, per the Toronto Star.<q> Some 25 trips involving 900 students already scheduled for the spring will go on as planned to prevent financial loss, but the board says all students will turn back if any one student is refused entry into the US.<q> Should Trump's executive order banning travelers from six countries "be fully implemented, resulting in any of our students being excluded from trips across the US border," those trips will be cancelled outright, Malloy says, per CTV News.<q> "It's not about politics, it's about our principles as a school board to be inclusive and equitable," adds a TDSB rep.<q> The Greater Essex County School Board in southwestern Ontario cited similar reasons when banning trips to the US for the month of February.<q> Toronto’s Ryerson University has halted trips until further notice, as have the Girl Guides of Canada, the Canadian version of the Girl Scouts, per CNN.<q> Other school boards say they could follow in the TDSB's footsteps "if travel advisories change."
– An aspiring model and former escort in Britain says she won't be selling tickets to her baby's birth after all, and has decided to quit smoking and drinking—all because she found out she was having a girl, not a boy.<q> Josie Cunningham, dubbed "Britain's most hated woman," now says she's "ashamed" of her plans to offer tickets to the birth at around $66,000 a pop and charge Skype viewers $330 to watch via livestream, reports the Daily Mirror.<q> At least four people had paid an apparently reduced price of $15,000 each per ticket, according to the Daily News.<q> Why else don't the Brits like her?<q> She had a breast augmentation paid for by the public health system, and told the Mirror earlier this year that she was being considered for Big Brother and would abort her baby if it would help her chances.<q> Then she apparently got upset upon learning that her baby would be another boy (she already has two sons).<q> So she coped by drinking and smoking, until doctors said last week that the baby will actually be a girl.<q> "I have been such a silly girl and have lots of regrets," Cunningham says.<q> "I can see that now I know I am going to have a daughter."
– If New York investigators are right, Richard Matt and David Sweat are probably sleeping right now—but they'll wake soon and continue picking their way through the woods and back roads toward Canada when darkness falls.<q> At an update today on the hunt for the prison escapees, authorities say they're now pretty sure the men are trying to make the border, reports NBC News.<q> "Based on what we know at this point, we have a high degree of confidence in our conclusion," says Maj. Charles Guess of the state police.<q> Guess didn't provide specifics, but he said investigators found "significant" items from the men in a cabin and in a field in the town of Malone yesterday and this morning, reports AP.<q> They've shifted their search accordingly in a bid to head the men off.<q> Matt and Sweat have eluded capture for three weeks now, which is impressive, but it doesn't protect them from this damning stat cited by the Atlantic: More than 92% of escapees from medium- and high-security prisons are caught within a year.<q> Their odds improve somewhat if they make it past a month, however.<q> The search update comes after a second prison worker was charged in the escape.<q> (He once likened the inmates at his prison in Dannemora to caged "puppies.")
– Obama fans might take heart.<q> The man they wanted to show up at last night's debate finally surfaced at a rally in Denver today.<q> Stories are using words like "feistier" (Washington Post), "aggressive" (the AP), "coming out swinging" (the Hill), and "fired up" (Politico) to describe the president's speech.<q> Some examples: That "very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney" last night must have been an imposter, said Obama, because "the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country all year promising $5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy, but the fellow onstage last night did not know anything about that."<q> "The Mitt Romney we all know invested in companies that were pioneers in outsourcing.<q> But the guy onstage last night said he doesn’t even know about laws that encourage offshoring."<q> “I mean thank goodness somebody is finally getting tough on Big Bird.<q> It’s about time.<q> We didn’t know that Big Bird was driving the federal deficit.<q> But that’s what we heard last night.<q> Elmo, too?"<q> “Gov.<q> Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth."<q> The Romney camp dismissed it all as "damage control."<q> The president adjusted to the altitude, apparently?
– The body of a 19-year-old U of Penn student was found last month in a California park, and as details of Blaze Bernstein's murder continue to emerge, so, too, does a disturbing picture of suspected killer Sam Woodward, 20, and the white supremacist group he's said to belong to.<q> ProPublica dives deep into Atomwaffen Division ("Atomwaffen" means "nuclear weapons" in German), whose internal message boards lit up after Bernstein's killing.<q> Members both celebrated Woodward as a "one man gay Jew wrecking crew" and raged that one of their own may have leaked Woodward's AWD affiliation.<q> Although the group is open about their hatred of minorities, Jews, and gays—and their love of Hitler and Charles Manson—it's a notoriously secretive bunch that doesn't take kindly to "rats and traitors."<q> ProPublica got its hands on about 250,000 AWD messages from encrypted logs on Discord, a chat platform meant for gamers but popular with white supremacist groups, with startling revelations.<q> The messages offer a frightening glimpse into the group's leaders, where members are located (as many as 20 cells may exist in several US states), and what "potential targets" may be, including water and electric utilities.<q> "We haven't seen anything like Atomwaffen in quite a while," a Southern Poverty Law Center researcher says.<q> "They should be taken seriously because they're so extreme."<q> Others, though, think while some members may be dangerous, most just indulge in "magical thinking" about government overthrows and spend their time reading fascist lit.<q> "It's very hard to go from talking about violence to looking a guy in the eyes and killing him," one expert says.<q> ProPublica's in-depth take also includes details on AWD's supposed leader, who goes by the nickname "Rape," and the ire ProPublica itself received after it tied Woodward to AWD in a Jan. 26 article.<q> "We really owe those jews at ProPublica," one member wrote in a chat message.<q> More on AWD here.
– Japan may be a losing a princess, but the imperial family sure isn't making the process an easy one: A proposed wedding between Princess Mako and her non-royal college sweetheart has hit yet another bump.<q> As Kyodo News reports, the princess' family is worried about a money issue swirling around the family of her potential future husband, Kei Komuro.<q> It seems that Komuro's mother used money from a former romantic partner to pay for her son's educational expenses.<q> Now there's apparently a rift between the two former lovers about repayment, and Mako's parents, Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko, want it publicly cleared up before any nuptials take place, according to Japanese media reports.<q> This isn't the first sign of trouble for the impending nuptials.<q> The couple initially announced plans to marry in November 2017, but abruptly postponed the wedding until 2020 and explained that they were rushing things.<q> And when New York's Fordham University announced that the princess' "fiance" would be attending law school there, the Japanese royal family chafed at the term "fiance" as the couple's engagement ceremony has not taken place, prompting the school to issue a new release without it.<q> Assuming Princess Mako goes through with the wedding, she will have to renounce her royal status, though the Guardian notes that the couple would get nearly $1 million from the government to help with that transition.<q> (All this is unfolding as the princess' grandfather, Emperor Akhito, prepares to abdicate next year.)
– It was a scene that could have been taken from countless TV dramas: Nine armed gang members arrived for a drug deal at a warehouse Wednesday night, only to discover they had been set up by undercover officers in a sting operation.<q> Police in Houston say two of the suspects managed to flee the warehouse.<q> One of them was shot dead after opening fire on SWAT officers who emerged from a staging area and identified themselves, KTRK reports.<q> The other man fled in a vehicle then hid in a quarry at the Houston Ship Channel when the vehicle crashed after a short chase, Houston Chronicle reports.<q> Police say he died of a heart attack in custody after being found and bitten by a K-9.<q> The other seven suspects, who were targeted by a months-long police and DEA operation, were arrested without incident and will be charged with federal crimes, police say.
– No black box data needed for this plane accident: Blame the cow.<q> An Indonesian passenger jet with more than 100 people aboard skidded off the runway after hitting a cow upon landing, reports the Guardian.<q> Luckily, all the humans were fine.<q> The cow didn't make it, however, reports the Age, which includes an unfortunate quote from the pilot about smelling "burning meat" as the plane touched down on the island of Sulawesi.<q> Indonesia has a lousy aviation safety record, notes the Aussie paper.<q> The last big mishap came in April when a jet from the same airline skidded into the sea.<q> Dozens were injured.
– Further inspection has revealed even more cracks in the top portion of the Washington Monument, which was damaged by this week's 5.9 magnitude earthquake.<q> Engineers discovered the cracks during a day-long inspection of the interior of the monument, AP reports.<q> A 4-inch crack was discovered during an inspection of the exterior by helicopter soon after the quake, which also damaged the National Cathedral.<q> The 555 foot-tall monument—the world's tallest stone structure—will remain closed to visitors indefinitely while engineers figure out how badly it has been damaged.<q> Visitors at the site yesterday said they were relieved the monument survived the quake.<q> "People may say the monument is broken like our political system,” one visitor tells the New York Times.<q> “But the fact is, it’s still standing and so are we."
– Another plane scare incident: A US passenger forced an international flight to be aborted after claiming he had a bomb in his luggage and a fake passport, the AP reports.<q> The passenger allegedly made threats while in the air on a Delta flight from Paris to Atlanta, causing it to be diverted to Bangor, Maine.<q> "We were told there was some danger and some threats made, but beyond that we weren't told anything else," said one passenger upon landing.<q> The man is in custody, and few details were available about him.<q> Two air marshals were aboard the plane and were "sitting on the guy's chest" upon arrival in Maine, a law enforcement official tells ABC.
– The death toll from what Israel's critics are calling a massacre of unarmed protesters in Gaza hit 59 overnight with the death of a baby from tear gas inhalation, according to Palestinian authorities.<q> The Palestinian Health Authority in Gaza says seven children under 18 were among the dozens of people killed when Israeli troops opened fire on protesters at the border fence Monday, the Washington Post reports.<q> More than 2,700 others were wounded, the authority says, including 1,359 injured by live ammunition.<q> Israel also dropped tear gas from drones in what was Gaza's deadliest day of violence since the 2014 war.<q> The latest developments: South Africa, Turkey withdraw ambassadors.<q> Israeli authorities say South Africa has recalled its ambassador to protest the shootings, the AP reports.<q> Turkey is withdrawing its ambassadors from both the US and Israel.<q> Kuwait drafted a United Nations Security Council resolution expressing outrage and calling for an independent investigation, but it was blocked by the US.
– Apple has started placing orders for screens for its next iPhone, and this time it's going big, according to a South Korean newspaper report picked up by Reuters.<q> The new displays will be 4.6-inch "retina" displays, and the updated phone will launch sometime around the second quarter this year, the paper said.<q> While Apple started the trend of smartphones with large touchscreens, its 3.5-inch screen has started to look diminutive next to offerings like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus' 4.65 inches.<q> But MacRumors is dubious about the report, noting that numerous previous whispers put the new screen at 4 inches, and that many companies making iPhone cases seem to be betting on that.<q> One source with a good track record said the new iPhone would have a longer, 4-inch display and an aluminum casing, but was "still in the engineering phase, not early production."<q> Apple Insider is also dubious of the second quarter launch date; previous reports have always put it in September or October.
– The latest crazy headline to come out of Justin Bieber's world tour: Thieves broke into a South African stadium early Monday and stole $330,000 from the safe, which had quite a bit of cash in it thanks to a weekend Bieber concert, Time reports.<q> Police think that's why the thieves went for it, and they also believe it was an inside job.<q> Spin calls the crime "a massive Ocean's 11-type heist," because the suspects used ropes and chisels to get into the safe room and were likely chiseling for several days, South Africa's Eyewitness News reports.<q> (This comes, of course, after headlines involving Bieber's monkey, Anne Frank, and marijuana, among other things.)
– Melissa Gilbert has had her breast implants removed, and in an extremely long blog post written on New Year's Eve but getting picked up now, she explains why.<q> But most of the blog post is taken up with an explanation of why she got them in the first place: She had "perfect A cup" boobs, and she was happy with them.<q> They grew to C cups during her first pregnancy, but after she stopped breastfeeding, when they deflated to their original size, they did not return to "their original place," she writes.<q> "They were lower....much, much lower."<q> Her then-husband once referred to her breasts as looking like "socks full of marbles with knots at the top," and though they ended up getting divorced, she remained insecure about her breasts and decided to get them augmented.<q> She got saline implants, and during her second pregnancy, the cycle repeated itself.<q> This time, while her boobs drooped a little post-breastfeeding, they remained "perky-ish" thanks to the implants.<q> But after 12 years, they needed to be replaced, so she got a breast lift and silicone implants.<q> That was when she realized she would need to keep replacing them: "It was possible that at 80 years old I might have to get new implants!"<q> She was also worried about the silicone and ultimately decided it was time to get the implants removed.<q> "The bottom line...or top line.. is that; A. I am concerned for my health and 2.<q> I don't like the way they look or feel.<q> Frankly, I'd like to be able to take a Zumba class without the fear that I'll end up with two black eyes."<q> Click for her full piece, which also includes a lot of commentary about society's expectations when it comes to a woman's appearance.
– Critics are impressed with certain aspects of The Help, Tate Taylor’s film about a young white woman interviewing black maids in 1960s Mississippi.<q> But while some say the overall package is lacking, others are glowing.<q> Compared to Kathryn Stockett’s novel of the same name, the film is “impactful in parts, but noticeably lacking in Stockett's instinctive nuance,” writes Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News.<q> “Taylor’s characters are familiar because we've seen them in movies so many times before: heroes and villains drawn in broad strokes, residents of a world regrettably lacking shades of gray.” In the New York Times, Manohla Dargis offers a similarly mixed reaction to the “big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum.” But “Viola Davis invests this cautious, at times bizarrely buoyant, movie with the gravity it frequently seems to want to shrug off.” Buoyancy isn’t a problem for Betsy Sharkey in the Los Angeles Times: “Laughter, which is ladled on thick as gravy, proves to be the secret ingredient—turning what should be a feel-bad movie about those troubled times into a heart-warming surprise.” And in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers notes that “a deeply touching human story filled with humor and heartbreak is rare in any movie season, especially summer.”
– Paris, a place for fashionistas and nudists alike?<q> Maybe.<q> Parisian city councilors have given the green light to a plan that would see the creation of a clothing-free zone somewhere within the city limits, the BBC reports.<q> The location of the nudist area has yet to be determined, but Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard—a supporter—said the intention is to prevent any disruption of "public order" and suggested two wooded areas, the westside Bois de Boulogne or eastside Bois de Vincennes.<q> France is famous for its nude beaches, and proponents—including the mayor—say that nudists should have a place within the capital city.<q> For a country that's said to have 2 million nudists, the capital has been a mostly unwelcoming place.<q> Currently, nudism in Paris is punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $16,800, reports France24.<q> It notes a single swimming pool in the city allows naked swimming, but even then, only after 9pm on certain days of the week.<q> Opponents worry about inflaming tensions between conservative and liberal groups, particularly on the heels of the burkini brouhaha.<q> Despite those objections, the BBC suggests the zone could be in place as early as next summer.
– The dispute between China and Vietnam, fueled by the contentious location of a Chinese oil rig, is heating up: Now China is accusing Vietnamese ships of ramming its vessels well over a thousand times during the last month, the BBC reports.<q> "As of 5pm on 7 June, there were as many as 63 Vietnamese vessels in the area at the peak... ramming the Chinese government ships for a total of 1,416 times," China says in a statement, which notes the ramming began shortly after it moved the rig on May 2.<q> And the country is defending that movement to a spot that it says "falls well within China's sovereignty and jurisdiction."<q> China's drilling is occurring far closer to its own islands, the Paracels, than to Vietnam's mainland, China claims.<q> Trouble is, Vietnam also claims the Paracel Islands.<q> Among China's justifications for its claim: It raised a flag on the islands in 1911, and a 1974 Vietnamese 9th-grade textbook allegedly says they're Chinese, the BBC notes.<q> For its part, Vietnam last week called on the US to "make further practical acts" to settle the disagreements "in accordance with international law."
– Volcanoes are usually in the news for their destructive power, but a new study suggests they've got some protective power to boast of as well.<q> Scientists think that bugs and plants have survived Antarctica's ice ages only because they found warmth near live volcanoes, reports AFP.<q> They did so either in underground caves formed in the ice or by camping out on ground warmed by geothermal heat, explains LiveScience.<q> "Volcanic steam can melt large ice caves under the glaciers, and it can be tens of degrees warmer in there than outside," says a lead researcher from the Australian National University.<q> "Caves and warm steam fields would have been great places for species to hang out during ice ages."<q> The finding—based in part on the discovery that more mosses, lichens, and small bugs are found near volcanoes today—helps answer a question that has vexed Antarctic researchers: How did species that have been in the region for millions of years manage to survive those ice ages?<q> Now it seems they waited them out in relative warmth before expanding their range again.<q> The researchers say their discovery likely holds true outside Antarctica as well, notes Nature World News.<q> (If you prefer volcanoes of the destructive variety, click to read about this doozy of 125 million years ago.)
– Reeva Steenkamp's mother says the 29-year-old South African model "was scared to take the relationship to the next level" with Oscar Pistorius, so she never slept with the man who eventually killed her, the Sunday Times reports via the New York Daily News and the BBC.<q> In the memoir Reeva: a Mother's Story, June Steenkamp says Pistorius and Steenkamp were together for several nights but never went all the way.<q> "She had confided to me that she hadn't slept with him," says June, whose book is being serialized by the Times and is out Nov. 6.<q> "There's no doubt in our minds that she decided to leave Oscar that night," says June.<q> She adds that "something went went horribly wrong, something upset her so terribly that she hid behind a locked door with two mobile phones," the Independent reports.<q> According to June, a jealous, "trigger-happy" Pistorius shot her daughter and fired three more bullets so she "couldn’t tell the world what really happened."<q> June goes on to describe the athlete as "pathetic," "moody," "shifty," and "arrogant."
– Doctors in South Africa had a wrenching dilemma: A baby in desperate need of a liver had been on the organ-donor waiting list for 181 days and wouldn't live much longer.<q> The child's mother pleaded with doctors to take a portion of her own liver for a transplant, but one big issue stood in the way: The mother has HIV.<q> Finally, surgeons at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre decided they had no choice and performed what is believed to be the world's first transplant from an HIV-positive donor, per a university release.<q> The surgery itself went well, and, more significantly, the child is HIV negative one year later.<q> It's too early to say whether that will hold true permanently, but the news is being hailed as a potentially big development, especially in countries such as South Africa where HIV is prevalent.<q> "This operation could be a game changer for South Africa," write three officials from the University of Witwatersrand (affiliated with the hospital) in the Conversation.<q> "The country has a large pool of virally suppressed HIV-positive people who have previously not been considered for living liver donation."<q> The piece details the ethical quandaries the hospital faced, including whether it would be right to deny the mother a chance to save her baby, even with the risk of HIV infection.<q> The story is drawing international attention, and in the US, Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health says doctors made the right choice—even if the child had emerged with HIV.<q> "If it is a choice between death and living reasonably well with a treatable infection, I think they made a quite reasonable choice," he tells the AP.<q> (A canceled HIV test resulted in a huge payout for one patient.)
– The Onion seems to have registered a rare misfire in the joke department.<q> It set off a scare at the US Capitol this morning with a fake tweet reading, “BREAKING: Witnesses reporting screams and gunfire heard inside Capitol building," reports the Washington Post.<q> A few others in a similar vein followed, and it turns out the site was promoting this satirical story, headlined "Congress Takes Group of Schoolchildren Hostage."<q> Capitol Police weren't laughing, issuing a statement that all was well at the building and adding that the fake reports were under investigation.<q> Reaction on the Internet has been mostly negative.<q> ("I mean, I know you guys do satire, but I really don't get this one..." went one typical Twitter post.<q> "The Onion botched a joke," says Gawker in its writeup.)<q> The Onion's New York office wasn't apologetic: "This is satire.<q> That’s how it works.” The tweets came a day after this guy got arrested and charged with plotting to blow up the Capitol.
– When Peter Butera got up to begin his valedictorian speech at his high school graduation ceremony in Exeter, Pa., on Friday, he probably never dreamed he'd be finishing it on Jimmy Kimmel Live!<q> four days later.<q> But on Tuesday night the 18-year-old class president appeared via Skype on the late-night talk show to recite the tail end of a speech that had been cut off by Wyoming Area Secondary Center administrators the week before.<q> CBS Philly reports that administrators shut off Butera's microphone after he veered off his pre-approved script to condemn what he called the "authoritative attitude" of some of the school's faculty and staff, an attitude, he said, that "prevents students from developing as true leaders.<q> Hopefully, this will change."<q> At which point his mic went silent.<q> The Wilkes-Barre Citizens' Voice quotes a statement from principal Jon Pollard in which he explains he felt obligated to stop Butera's speech in order to "ensure the remainder of [it] was not demeaning or derogatory to his classmates, the underclassmen, faculty, staff or administration."<q> The Washington Post talks to a friend of Butera's who says Butera was frustrated by having numerous ideas turned down by Pollard during his four years as class president.<q> (Other off-script lines from Butera: "At our school, the title of class president can more accurately be class party planner.<q> Student council’s main obligation is to paint signs every week.")<q> The Villanova-bound Butera doesn’t think his speech could have gone any better: "I got my point across and them cutting the microphone proved my point to be true."<q> (Valedictorians have had issues before.)
– Roseanne Barr's quick return to Twitter was full of apologies for a racist tweet.<q> But Barr, who told Twitter followers not to defend her after ABC canceled her hit show and talent agency ICM Partners severed ties, has now taken to retweeting users coming to her defense, reports CNBC.<q> "You had no idea VJ had any black blood … U made a political joke that fell flat," reads one comment retweeted by Barr on Wednesday, referring to the subject of Barr's racist tweet, Valerie Jarrett.<q> Another retweeted comment reads, "I look like a monkey.<q> Why?<q> My DNA is 96% similar to a monkey's.<q> It makes scientific sense," per the Washington Post.<q> Other Barr tweets are also getting attention, including two targeting billionaire philanthropist George Soros.<q> The 87-year-old, who was 13 when Nazis invaded his native Hungary, "turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth" and now aims to "overthrow" the US "by buying/backing candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law & favor 'feelings,'" Barr claimed Tuesday.<q> Donald Trump Jr. retweeted the claims to his 2.8 million followers, despite the New York Times describing them as "baseless."<q> Soros "did not collaborate with the Nazis.<q> He did not help round people up.<q> He did not confiscate anybody’s property," a rep says in a statement, calling the accusations insulting "to all Jewish people, and to anyone who honors the truth."
– Many of HealthCare.gov's well chronicled problems have reportedly been fixed, but that doesn't mean it's ready for prime time, insurers say.<q> The site's ability to send consumer data to insurance companies remains flawed, and "until the enrollment process is working from end to end, many consumers will not be able to enroll in coverage," says insurance trade group head Karen Ignagni.<q> People have been calling insurers thinking they've signed up for a plan, but insurers have been missing some information—or lack any record of the transaction, the New York Times reports.<q> Although insurers "don’t have the responsibility or the capability to fix the system, they’re reliant on it," says one consultant.<q> "Somehow people are getting lost in the process," says one exec.<q> "If they go to a doctor or a hospital and we have no record of them, that will be very upsetting to consumers."<q> Sometimes, it remains unclear how much coverage the government is paying for, and insurers are concerned about late payments from the government.<q> Some insurers and states are pushing for a way to leapfrog the federal site, the Wall Street Journal reports.<q> Connecticut, for instance, wants to rely on its own data for confirming enrollees' citizenship and other information.
– Just another day in the life of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford: He's being sued by his sister's ex-boyfriend for allegedly conspiring to have the man beaten in jail.<q> A lawsuit submitted by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford's abuse of alcohol and drugs.<q> The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye knew about Ford's alcohol and drug use and claims he was threatened with "dire consequences" if he did not remain quiet.<q> "They wanted to know if I was going to do the right thing—was I going to keep my mouth shut," MacIntyre tells the Globe and Mail.<q> He got attacked in a jailhouse shower and ended up with a broken leg and shattered teeth.<q> Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said today that the allegations are "without fact or foundation."<q> Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit.<q> "Remind me again, how the hell is Rob Ford still in office?"<q> asks Jordan Yerman at the Vancouver Observer.
– Police responding to a call about a suspicious package on a downtown San Francisco street yesterday found what a spokeswoman calls "an extremely gruesome crime scene."<q> Next to a pile of garbage and debris, a rolling suitcase held dismembered human body parts, police say, per the San Francisco Chronicle.<q> In case that isn't horrific enough, the police rep tells USA Today the body was so mutilated, a medical examiner was needed to determine if it belonged to a human or animal.<q> A search turned up more body parts at three locations within a three-block radius, the Los Angeles Times reports, though it isn't clear if they belong to the victim in the suitcase, whose race, gender, and identity is unknown.<q> "There was one crime scene—it was just very large," the rep says, adding authorities have a "preliminary, distinct suspect description" and are "actively attempting to locate this particular person of interest."<q> The same rep tells CNN, "We do have people of interest that homicide investigators are speaking to."<q> Police are also attempting to nab surveillance footage from nearby businesses.<q> Officers first arrived to the scene in the South of Market area around 4:15pm yesterday, but it isn't clear when the suitcase was left.<q> USA Today describes the spot as a "long-troubled area" known for its high population of homeless people.<q> Twitter's headquarters sits just about a block away.
– Amazon is ramping up its competition with Netflix: The latter has House of Cards, and now Amazon has its own original series set in DC... with "House" in the title.<q> Alpha House was created by Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau, who also writes the series about four Republican senators living together.<q> The pilot (which features cameos by Bill Murray and Stephen Colbert) went online a month ago, along with 13 others, and Amazon looked at customer feedback to determine which to pick up for a full season.<q> Alpha House was one of just two comedy pilots to make the cut.<q> The Washington Post describes Alpha House as "political satire" in which the senators, played by John Goodman, Mark Consuelos, Clark Johnson, and Matt Malloy "live like frat brothers."<q> It was inspired by a real Capitol Hill property in which Democratic senators have lived over the years, and it's been kicking around in Trudeau's brain since 2008.<q> Notes the director of Amazon Studios, "When it comes to Washington and its foibles and what makes it unique, few people have been more insightful and more knowledgeable than Garry Trudeau."
– The investigation into the relationship between Virginia Gov.<q> Bob McDonnell and Jonnie R. Williams Sr., CEO of Star Scientific, continues, with a new $130,000 reveal.<q> Williams gave $70,000 to a McDonnell-owned corporation last year, another $50,000 to McDonnell's wife, Maureen, in 2011, and $10,000 to McDonnell's daughter in December, sources tell the Washington Post.<q> The governor didn't disclose any of those amounts.<q> Previously revealed gifts included another "wedding gift" for McDonnell's daughter and a $6,500 Rolex, among other things.<q> More unpleasantness for the McDonnell family: Sean McDonnell, the governor's 21-year-old son, was busted early Saturday on a public drunkenness charge, the Daily Progress reports.<q> Police found him intoxicated in Charlottesville, where he attends the University of Virginia.<q> And, facing pressure over the misuse of Executive Mansion resources for his family, McDonnell recently paid the state $2,400 to reimburse it for food and household supplies his kids used, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports.<q> Specifically, McDonnell has been accused of sending things like paper towels and laundry detergent back to college with his children.
– The attack on Istanbul's airport that left dozens dead and hundreds injured Tuesday was likely organized by a one-armed Chechen terrorist who goes by "Akhmed One-Arm," Fox News reports.<q> A news organization in Turkey identified Ahmed Chatayev as the organizer of the terrorist attack, as did US officials, according to CNN.<q> The news has yet to be confirmed by officials in Turkey.<q> A report released in October said Chatayev was part of a "group of militants that was planning attacks against US and Turkish facilities.” He is or was a top ISIS soldier, and the UN says he has 130 militants directly under his command.<q> "He's... probably the No.<q> 1 enemy in the Northern Caucasus region of Russia," US Rep. Michael McCaul tells CNN.<q> Heavy has a list of five things to know about Chatayev, including that he claims he lost his arm while being tortured in a Russian prison but may have actually lost it in combat.<q> He spent time as a political prisoner in Georgia and has been arrested in Sweden and the Ukraine in the past decade or so.<q> Amnesty International helped prevent Chatayev from being extradited to Russia, where he was wanted, claiming he would be tortured there.<q> Only two of the three suicide bombers that killed 44 people and wounded more than 200 at Ataturk Airport have been identified, but US officials don't believe Chatayev was the third.<q> The bombers have been linked to Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.<q> And while ISIS hasn't claimed responsibility, officials believe the terrorist organization is behind the attack.
– Joseph Stack’s anger at big government in general and the Internal Revenue Service in particular sounds very much like another of the day’s big noise-makers to Jonathan Capehart.<q> “After reading his 34-paragraph screed,” Capehart writes in a Washington Post blog of the Austin suicide pilot, “I am struck by how his alienation is similar to that we’re hearing from the extreme elements of the Tea Party movement.” This is just the type of finger-pointing that makes Dennis Bakay’s blood boil.<q> “I’m not about to blame Joe Stack’s kamikaze mission on Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, or the Tea Baggers like some on the left,” he writes for Philly2Philly.<q> “That is irresponsible and reprehensible … purely agenda-driven and not looking at the facts.”
– A California 16-year-old is the new world champion of Tetris.<q> Joseph Saelee beat Jonas Neubauer in the Classic Tetris World Championship grand final Sunday night in Oregon; a definite stunner, per Kotaku, considering Neubauer, a 37-year-old taproom manager, has come out on top seven times in the eight years the tournament has been held.<q> Saelee, on the other hand, just started playing after watching the 2016 championships, he tells the BBC.<q> And yes, he plays the iconic video game on an original 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console.<q> Saelee, it should be noted, is 13 years younger than the NES version of the block stacking game.<q> You can watch nearly seven hours of gaming in our video gallery or just skip to the winning moment; if you're not convinced all those hours are worth it, take note of what Alex Walker writes at Kotaku: "The Classic Tetris World Championships is one of the best gaming events to spectate all year.<q> It's easy to understand, gets real intense, and the commentary adds a ton to the proceedings."<q> (To lose weight, play Tetris?)
– Ladies, you know your biological clock—the one that "ticks" away as you start feeling like it might be time to reproduce?<q> Well, it turns out the sound of an actual ticking clock can speed up your reproductive timing, making you want to have babies earlier, according to a new study published in Springer's journal Human Nature.<q> Researchers asked men and women questions about their reproductive attitudes—things like when they'd like to marry and have kids and how much they'd be willing to alter their "requirements" for a mate in order to start a family earlier—and they found that the sound of a ticking clock influenced women's answers, possibly because it made them think about the passage of time.<q> "The very subtle sound prime of a ticking clock changed the timing with which women sought to have children and the traits they sought in potential partners—both central aspects of women’s mating-related psychology," says one of the lead researchers.<q> Women who grew up in lower socioeconomic areas were particularly affected, wanting to get married and start families even earlier—and placing a lower priority on their mate's status and earning potential—than women who were raised with more resources.<q> Not surprisingly, men, who can typically father children well into their later years, were not affected by the clock sound.<q> As Jesse Singal notes in New York, "all sorts of subtle cues can affect how people answer questions," but this result is still "kinda weird."<q> (Click to read about why some doctors don't think freezing your eggs is a good idea.)
– Sgt.<q> Pepper better have good insurance because—if its name is accurate—his Lonely Hearts Club Band has a dramatically increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.<q> According to a study published Monday in Heart, people who feel lonely or are socially isolated have a 29% increase in risk of coronary heart disease and a 32% increase in risk of stroke.<q> While previous studies have shown a person's general health is influenced by their social relationships, this may be the first to show "deficiencies in social relationships" are no good for your heart.<q> Medical Daily reports researchers looked at 23 studies—a total of 181,000 people—about loneliness, social isolation, and health to come to their conclusion.<q> The Guardian notes that coronary heart disease and strokes are the two leading causes of death in first-world countries.<q> And the new study shows loneliness and social isolation are bigger risk factors for those problems than either work stress or general anxiety.<q> “People have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected,” the New York Times quotes study co-author Nicole Valtorta as saying.<q> “Our study shows that if this is a risk factor, then we should be trying to prevent the risk factor in the first place.” The research is especially important as other studies show social isolation growing and young people feeling more lonely than ever before.<q> (Also bad—and potentially lethal—for your heart?<q> Heartbreak.)
– A pediatric anesthesiologist at the University of Colorado's medical school is losing her job there after racist Facebook comments directed toward Michelle Obama were flagged, the Denver Post and Denver 7 report.<q> Dr. Michelle Herren reportedly posted a photo that showed the first lady screaming with the comment, "Doesn't seem to be speaking too eloquently here, thank god we can't hear her!<q> Harvard???<q> That's a place for 'entitled' folks said all the liberals!"<q> She then added: "Monkey face and poor ebonic English!!!<q> There!<q> I feel better and am still not racist!!!<q> Just calling it like it is!"<q> Also calling it like it is: Joann Nieto, who informed the university of the comments after she saw the post stayed up for four days.<q> A school spokesman said Thursday "we are beginning the process to terminate Dr. Herren's faculty appointment" (a nonpaid position), adding she has "compromised her ability" to teach and care for patients.<q> It's not yet clear what the fate of her $363,00-a-year job at Denver Health Medical Center will be, though it confirms to Denver 7 she won't be seeing patients "until further notice."<q> A rep adds, "We are bumping up against a First Amendment right," with the Post noting it's difficult to fire public-sector employees who make offensive remarks when they're not at work.<q> Herren tells Denver 7 her remarks were taken "out of context" and were in response to another comment that argued people can criticize Melania Trump freely but the same isn't true for Obama.<q> She added she had no idea "monkey face" might be considered offensive.
– Gretchen Carlson made waves last month when she voiced approval for an assault weapons ban, but that was nothing compared to the bomb she dropped Wednesday: that she's no longer employed by Fox News and she's filing a sexual harassment and wrongful termination suit against her former boss, Roger Ailes, Politico reports.<q> "As you may have heard, I'm no longer with @FoxNews.<q> I value your support and friendship so please stay in touch," the now-former host of The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson tweeted Wednesday, adding links to her social media pages and website.<q> The news about her suit was emailed to reporters from the law firm representing her, noting her contract had been terminated June 23, even though Fox never announced it; Carlson's own tweets from last month suggested she was simply on vacation.<q> The complaint alleges Ailes made "sexually-charged comments [to Carlson], ranging from lewd innuendo, ogling and remarks about Ms. Carlson's body to demands for sex as a way for her to improve her job standing."<q> Those remarks reportedly included statements about Carlson's legs and behind, requests that she wear form-fitting outfits, and "sexist comments."<q> She also claims she was fired in 2013 from her co-host chair on Fox & Friends and given less money for her own show after she complained about "demeaning and discriminatory behavior on and off the set," specifically from co-host Steve Doocy, per an attorney statement.<q> "Opposing sexism and rejecting unwanted sexual come-ons should never cost a woman her job or subject her to disparagement and emotional anguish," another lawyer tells Politico.<q> As for Carlson herself, she says in her own statement: "I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career.<q> Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace."<q> Read Ailes' response here.
– Bodega owner Pedro Quezada has seen his share of hard times.<q> The 44-year-old father of five lives with his wife and kids in Passaic, one of the poorest areas of North Jersey; years ago, a fire destroyed much of their store, and just one year later, thieves stole everything they could from the family's apartment.<q> But now, finally, Quezada's luck has changed: On Saturday, as he did every night, he bought a Powerball ticket from Eagle Liquors—but this time, his was the winning ticket.<q> He returned to Eagle Liquors last night to reveal himself to his excited neighbors as the winner of the $338 million jackpot.<q> With the lump sum payment, he'll take home about $152 million after taxes, the Record reports.<q> He also broke the news to his family: He called them only after signing the ticket, telling his wife, "I'm a millionaire, Ines.<q> Did you hear?"<q> Neighbors described the couple as quiet but hard-working, and expressed happiness at their good fortune.<q> "I'm just glad it went to somebody that could use it," says one.<q> Another calls the win "a blessing for the neighborhood," because "it gives people hope that there is a blessing somewhere, for somebody."<q> As for what Quezada will do with the money, he says, "I want to help a lot of people, in whatever they need, in rent, in whatever."<q> First, he'll help his family, the AP reports.<q> In Spanish, he told reporters that he's "very happy."
– Nigel Sykes' attempted robbery of a Delaware pizzeria failed miserably—but he'd still like to get some cash out of the whole to-do.<q> Armed with a gun, Sykes, 23, busted into the back door of Newport's Seasons Pizza in 2010 but eventually got tackled by employees.<q> In a federal civil complaint, filed without an attorney, Sykes admits, "I committed a robbery at Seasons Pizza" but now alleges that the workers "unnecessary" roughed him up during that robbery, the News Journal reports.<q> He wants $260,000 from the pizzeria, its employees, and Delaware State Police for his troubles.<q> Though NBC Philadelphia reports similar complaints from Sykes have been thrown out in the past, a judge has so far allowed this latest suit—which Newport's police chief calls "a joke"—to move forward.<q> Sykes' self-written suit alleges the pizzeria's employees forced his gun from his hand, then "participated in punching, kicking and pouring hot soup over my body" while "I was unarmed and defenseless."<q> Sykes, who's serving a 15-year sentence for robbery and attempted robbery, also argues he was knocked unconscious and awoke to two police officers using stun guns on him.
– It's Thursday, but it might as well be Kanye Day.<q> The rapper unveiled both his new album—The Life of Pablo—and clothing line—Yeezus Season 3—during an event at Madison Square Gardens in New York City.<q> The whole thing was livestreamed around the world.<q> And, as with most things having to do with Kanye West, it was all the Internet was talking about.<q> Here are five things you need to know about Kanye's day: It was huge.<q> The Verge reports more than 20 million tried to watch the stream of the nearly two-hour event at one time.<q> "The early viewership numbers are insane…There aren't many other musicians who could pull this off."<q> Lamar Odom was there.<q> It was the former NBA player's first public appearance since nearly dying following an overdose at a Nevada brothel in October, according to People.<q> Odom continues to recover from his coma and sat with estranged wife Khloé Kardashian after entering with the rest of West's family.<q> Kanye made a video game.<q> The Verge reports it's called Only One and depicts his late mother "traveling through the gates of heaven," apparently alternating between her own set of wings and a pegasus.<q> West says a lot of people turned down his pitch for the game.<q> Martin Shkreli tried to steal his thunder.<q> The legally troubled "pharma bro" offered West $10 million for The Life of Pablo, hoping to delay or prevent its release to the public, according to the New York Times.<q> "Instead of releasing this product for your millions of fans, I ask you to sell this recording solely to me," Shkreli tweeted.<q> "I believe you (and your partners) will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action."<q> Kanye is still super quotable.<q> Cosmopolitan lists 16 of the lyrical highlights from The Life of Pablo, including "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that [expletive] famous" and—inevitably—"I love you like Kanye loves Kanye."
– If other GOP contenders shrugged off Ted Cruz's chances of winning the nomination, it's a safe bet they're reassessing things after four new super PACS announced they'd raised a staggering $31 million to support his new candidacy.<q> "Even in the context of a presidential campaign cycle in which the major party nominees are expected to raise more than $1.5 billion, Cruz’s haul is eye-popping, one that instantly raises the stakes in the Republican fundraising contest," writes Mark Halperin at Bloomberg.<q> The super PACs in question are only a week old, and it's unprecedented to have raised so much so quickly.<q> So who's behind the money?<q> The New York Times identifies the main player as a "reclusive Long Islander" named Robert Mercer.<q> Mercer began his career at IBM but now runs a hedge fund called Renaissance Technologies, and like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson, he is taking advantage of the Citizens United case that loosened restrictions on wealthy donors.<q> He's "a very low-profile guy, but he’s becoming a bigger and bigger player,” says one campaign finance expert.<q> And his backing of Cruz “sends the message to other donors that Cruz is a serious guy,” which in turn encourages other donors.<q> The Times notes that Mercer's hedge fund is under investigation by the IRS, an agency that Cruz would love to abolish.<q> A previous profile of Mercer at Bloomberg describes him as "one of the most powerful men in Republican politics that nobody is talking about."
– Whoops.<q> The White House had to make a strange about-face today and acknowledge that President Obama has, in fact, met his Uncle Omar.<q> Not only that, but the younger Obama actually lived with his uncle for a few weeks in Cambridge in the 1980s, reports the Boston Globe.<q> The tidbit surfaced this week during Onyango Obama's deportation hearing in Boston.<q> Onyango—Omar is his nickname—testified that his nephew stayed with him for a brief spell when Barack arrived in town to attend Harvard Law School.<q> “It’s a good thing to let your nephew stay with you,” he said afterward, explaining that "your brother’s kids are your kids as well.” This wouldn't have caused headlines if not for the fact that a White House spokesman said in 2011—after Omar's arrest for drunken driving—that the two had never met.<q> Jay Carney explained the mistake today by saying no staffers had actually asked the president in person, reports the LA Times.<q> This time, they did.<q> “The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in a decade," he added.<q> But given that Omar was allowed to remain in the country, maybe that will change?
– R. Allen Stanford's epic fall from billionaire to imprisoned fraudster came to a conclusion today as a judge sentenced him to 110 years in prison, reports the Wall Street Journal.<q> Stanford was convicted in March of bilking investors in a $7 billion Ponzi scheme that spanned 20 years.<q> Prosecutors sought 230 years, calling him a "ruthless predator" who orchestrated one of the biggest frauds in history.<q> Stanford's lawyers hoped to get him out on time already served.<q> Investors weren't having any of that: "You, sir, are a dirty rotten scoundrel," said one of the victims allowed to address the court, notes Forbes.
– Dell has reached a deal to go private, the company has announced.<q> Shareholders will receive some $13.65 per share in a $24 billion deal, the New York Times reports, which marks a 25% premium over Dell's January share price.<q> The privatization deal with Microsoft and private equity company Silver Lake Partners is the biggest since the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal notes.<q> Once the biggest PC maker on the planet, the struggling Dell is now third; the move comes as founder and CEO Michael Dell hopes to retool his company.<q> The deal incorporates Michael Dell's own 16% stake, some $700 million from his investment company, $1 billion from Silver Lake, and a $2 billion Microsoft investment.<q> In return, Dell will likely work more closely with Windows, as was previously rumored.<q> Meanwhile, four banks are backing the deal with $15 billion in evenly-divided debt.<q> For Michael Dell, the company's floundering image is central to the overhaul, the Journal adds: "It's pretty simple: His name is on the door," says a former exec.
– Much like in real life, Matt Damon's character in the sci-fi thriller Elysium isn't too fond of government bureaucrats.<q> Set in royally screwed-up Los Angeles (home to the masses) and an idyllic space station in the clouds (home to the rich) circa 2154, this flick from Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has both the compelling themes and action-packed fight scenes to make it a summer blockbuster.<q> So is it one?<q> Critics are split.<q> The action sequences, complete with "futuristic CGI flying machines" are impressive, but it's "Blomkamp's critique of a society riven by class and racial differences" that sets it apart, Soren Anderson writes for the Seattle Times.<q> "Few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as Blomkamp does here."<q> But at the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan's high hopes were dashed.<q> "Elysium is no promised land."<q> Though Matt Damon is great as always and the visuals are equally as impressive, "the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped."<q> District 9 did a much better job of connecting genre (sci-fi) and theme ("socio-political concerns").<q> Even with the talented Damon along for the ride, Dana Stephens at Slate writes Elysium "does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot... Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns, or staging high-tech fistfights.<q> It’s a waste of a perfectly good dystopia."<q> But over at the Philadelphia Inquirer, Steven Rea sees things differently.<q> "Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-hand-basket spectacles, Elysium takes the cake."<q> Sure, it can be a little generic at times—"haven't we just seen all this head-bashing, hanging-from-catwalks, mixed-martial-arts mayhem in The Wolverine and Iron Man 3?—but "as summer movie sci-fi extravaganzas go, Elysium is easily the best thing out there right now."
– When Ryan Garcia and his wife welcomed their new baby into the world last year, Ryan got inspired to begin what the Dayton Daily News calls "a kindness revolution."<q> He resolved for the entire year of 2012 to perform a random act of kindness every day.<q> “I decided I wanted to do something that would inspire her in the future," said the new dad.<q> "I wanted to be a better person."<q> And so Ryan launched his year of altruism.<q> Examples: “I tracked down my sixth-grade teacher, Mr. Plecas, and wrote him a letter thanking him for being my favorite teacher ever."<q> He also sent a condolence letter to a family who lost their son in the Afghanistan war.<q> In one day, he complimented 25 strangers, and on another day he stood on the corner doling out free hugs.<q> Yesterday, he took firefighters to lunch.<q> You can keep track of his random feats at his blog, 366randomacts.org.<q> (He's up to day 39).
– While we all love our smartphones, laptops, and other tech gadgets, it's inaccurate to refer to them as "sexy"—unless of course you plan to make love to them, says Gizmodo writer Mat Honan.<q> The characterization has become so standard among tech reviewers, Honan believes it's time readers call out the cliche: "The next time you see a professional writer refer to an inanimate object full of circuitry and cadmium as 'sexy,' please inquire as to whether said writer does in fact find it to be arousing."<q> It's lazy writing, and "it means you don't give a damn about your audience."<q> Since "sexy" is a descriptor pretty much everyone old enough to buy a gadget can understand, writers don't hesitate to throw it around to easily get their point across.<q> "Maybe you actually do want to get it on with your iPhone.<q> Maybe you really do find vaporware coffeemakers sexually stimulating.<q> That's fine!<q> No judgment from me," Honan writes.<q> "But make it clear.<q> Let your readers know that you plan to make sweet, sweet love to that all-in-one printer."<q> (Click to see a few examples of "sexy"-usage offenders, here, here, and here.)
– Coalition forces pounded targets in Libya for a third night yesterday, but the general leading US forces says the pace of air attacks is likely to slow soon.<q> The campaign to destroy Moammar Gadhafi's air defenses and establish a no-fly zone is almost complete, and American officials are seeking to hand over leadership of the operation to European allies, reports the New York Times.<q> "My sense is that unless something unusual or unexpected happens, we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks, " said Gen. Carter Ham.<q> Coalition forces aren't attempting to provide air cover for rebels, he added, warning of a potentially long stalemate between Gadhafi's forces and the rebels, AP reports.<q> President Obama says that he expects control of the operation to be handed over within days.<q> "It is US policy that Gadhafi needs to go,” he told reporters.<q> “And we’ve got a wide range of tools in addition to our military effort to support that policy."
– The mission: to airlift 1,156 desert tortoises to a place where there's no threat of being flattened by tanks.<q> The Marines are this month moving the reptiles out of a corner of California's Mojave Desert where the Corps will soon begin extensive live-fire training, the Los Angeles Times reports.<q> Packed up two per plastic bin, the hubcap-sized creatures are being loaded into helicopters and flown 25 miles away to federal lands beyond the Marines' Twentynine Palms base northeast of Palm Springs.<q> Their new home is far enough away to keep tortoises from wandering back into the line of fire when the Marines begin "longer and more involved" training exercises this summer that the Press-Enterprise reports will better position them to carry out missions in "global hot spots."<q> Operation Desert Tortoise doesn't come cheap: Its $50 million price tag covers everything from the 125 biologists USNI News describes as setting out to locate, examine, and box up the tortoises to an agreed-upon 30 years of monitoring.<q> The Marines have been pushing for this move since 2008, an effort complicated by the tortoises' "threatened" status.<q> Environmentalists threatened to sue, citing the harm that taking away 100 square miles of habitat might do, but the Times reports the program got final approval after the US Fish and Wildlife Service said it couldn't finish its review before the spring relocation window closed.<q> A biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity expressed concerns there might not be adequate food in the new habitat.<q> (This really old tortoise is the "savior" of the Galapagos.)
– The six-city launch of the new BlackBerry 10 phones and operating system is now complete.<q> One of the biggest shockers from the event: Research in Motion is scrapping its name, and will now be known simply as BlackBerry.<q> Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the "heartfelt and brutal honesty" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes.<q> It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late.<q> Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen.<q> Heins said the Q10 was created for customers "that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience," reports USA Today.<q> The company also added some star power, announcing that Alicia Keys would be its new Global Creative director, a position created for her, the Verge reports.<q> The company also boasted that Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project.<q> On to the features.<q> First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10.<q> It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft's latest Windows iteration.<q> BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using.<q> Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry's dominance among business users.<q> It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile.<q> As for hardware, BlackBerry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging.<q> The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier.<q> The phones will be available tomorrow in the UK, but the US will have to cool its heel until March.
– Perhaps teeing up his next apology, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte continued his string of inflammatory, anti-US statements by telling President Obama to "go to hell" Tuesday, Reuters reports, after the US refused to sell him weapons to continue his violent crackdown on drug dealers.<q> "If you don't want to sell arms, I'll go to Russia," Duterte said.<q> "I sent the generals to Russia and Russia said 'do not worry, we have everything you need, we'll give it to you.'<q> And as for China, they said 'just come over and sign and everything will be delivered.'<q> " Duterte previously called Obama a "son of a bitch," and a State Department rep calls his latest stance "at odds with the warm relationship" the two countries have long enjoyed.<q> Duterte's bloody campaign is averaging 38 deaths a day, Al-Jazeera reported in September, and his methods have drawn harsh criticism from the international community, including the US.<q> Duterte on Tuesday expressed frustration at this slight, saying: "Instead of helping us, the first to hit was the State Department.<q> So you can go to hell, Mr. Obama, you can go to hell."<q> He then threatened to "break up" with the US, then added, for good measure: "EU, better choose purgatory.<q> Hell is full already.<q> Why should I be afraid of you?"<q> (On Sunday, he was busily apologizing to the Jewish community for a jab about Adolf Hitler.)
